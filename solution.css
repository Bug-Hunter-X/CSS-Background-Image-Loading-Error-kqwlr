To fix this issue, double-check the path to your image file. Use relative paths carefully, and if necessary, use absolute paths or a path relative to your CSS file's location. You can also add a fallback background color or image to handle cases where the primary image can't load.  For example:

```css
.element {
  background-image: url('images/image.jpg'); /* Always use forward slashes */
  background-color: #eee; /* Fallback color */
  background-size: cover;
}
```
Consider using a browser's developer tools to inspect the network tab to see if the image is being requested, and if it's returning any errors. This provides clear visibility into network requests and any issues that can occur.  Also ensure the image file actually exists in the specified location.
