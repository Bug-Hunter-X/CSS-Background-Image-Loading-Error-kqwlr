This repository demonstrates a common CSS bug involving background images that fail to load due to incorrect paths or missing files.  The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code, while `solution.css` offers a corrected version. The bug is subtle because there are no obvious error messages; the background simply doesn't show up. The solution emphasizes proper path management and robust error handling.
